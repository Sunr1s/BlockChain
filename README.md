#University Scientific Work: Prototype Blockchain Node
##Introduction

This project aims to develop a prototype blockchain node for a decentralized financial system. The prototype will demonstrate the basic functionality of a blockchain node, such as validating transactions, creating blocks and maintaining the ledger. The prototype will be a proof-of-concept for a decentralized financial system and will help to identify potential problems and limitations of such a system.
##Decentralized Finance Problems

Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a rapidly growing area in the blockchain industry, but there are several challenges that need to be addressed in order to make DeFi a viable alternative to traditional financial systems. Some of these challenges include:

    Scalability: As DeFi becomes more popular, the number of transactions on the blockchain will increase, which can lead to scalability issues. The blockchain must be able to handle a large number of transactions in a short amount of time in order to ensure a seamless user experience.
    Interoperability: DeFi applications are built on different blockchain platforms, which can lead to interoperability issues. This means that users may not be able to easily transfer assets between different DeFi applications, which can lead to a fragmented user experience.
    Security: DeFi is a new and rapidly evolving area, and there is a risk of security vulnerabilities and attacks. This can lead to the loss of user funds and undermine the trust in DeFi.
    Regulation: DeFi operates in a regulatory grey area, and it is unclear how regulators will respond to DeFi in the future. This can lead to uncertainty for users and developers and may limit the growth of DeFi.

##Conclusion

The prototype blockchain node for a decentralized financial system will help to address some of the challenges facing DeFi. By demonstrating the basic functionality of a blockchain node, the prototype will provide a proof-of-concept for a decentralized financial system and help to identify potential problems and limitations. However, DeFi is a complex and rapidly evolving area, and there are several challenges that need to be addressed in order to make DeFi a viable alternative to traditional financial systems.

##Client Code

The handleClient function is the main client loop that handles user interactions with the prototype blockchain node. The function takes user input and splits it into different commands, which are then handled by various switch cases.

The /exit command is used to exit the program. The /user command is used to display information about the user, such as their address, purse, and balance. The /chain command is used to display information about the blockchain, such as the chain's transactions, balance, and printout.
##Node Code

The handleServer function is responsible for handling incoming requests from other nodes in the decentralized financial system. The function uses the nt.Handle function to handle different types of requests, such as adding a block, adding a transaction, getting a block, getting the last hash, and getting the balance. Each of these functions is responsible for a specific task within the prototype blockchain node.
